Notes after experiments + discussion of the calibration

> Why are the sensitivity profiles of microphones so noisy ('bumpy'). 
	* Does it have to do with the fact that we're using white noise?
	* Would a calibration that uses a sweep produce different kinds of 
	sensitivity profiles? 
	* What is the effect/role of frequency bins here? 
> Does it make sense to measure a time-averaged spectrum (e.g. like a periodogram)
> What about utilising multiple playbacks within each session - does that 
improve the smoothness of the profile? 
> Look into the +2 dB received level measurements -- where is that coming from? 
If it is human position related, it must be in dramatic in the last few recordings
esp. when people got up and moved to one side of the room.
