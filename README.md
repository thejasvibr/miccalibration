# About this repo

This repo consists of code to perform mic calibrations using the substitution method. This relies on a calibration microphone recording a playback sound - which is then also recorded by the target microphone. 

The code + workflow here has been tested at the 2024 Brumm group retreat. 

It is a work in progress - and is likely to be fully usable only post May 2025.
